Dotfiles
==============================
Portable runtime configuration

This is an attempt to make my 'dotfiles' (i.e., .vimrc, .zshrc) portable
between environments.  

I want to also include facilities for programatically managing deploying these
files, as well as fetching them into the repository directory.  I plan to do
this via `make`.
